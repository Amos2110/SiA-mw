<p>Nelson Bwede Zakeyu Chole's performances are more than celebratory but emblematic of what fan support can look like: creative, united, and wholeheartedly rooted in team spirit.</p>

<p>Bwede’s journey—from rhythmic chants in the terraces to being a household name at fan functions—exemplifies the power of passion and originality. In a sea of blue and white, his steel-beat anthems are the heartbeat of Mighty Wanderers’ fandom. Through melody and message, he continues to unite supporters, boost team morale, and leave an indelible mark on Malawian supporter culture.</p>

<p>Bwede’s signature talent lies in composing and leading sing‑along chants bolstered by hoe‑steel beats—improvised percussion using farm tools that mimic drums. His energetic rhythms and witty lyrics create infectious moments:

“Ng’ona, ng’ona, ng’ona ilibe mabere…”

“Paulele eeh peulele eeeehhhh…” 

“Sin’naiigwire, sin’naiigwire manja anga ndi awa…” </p>

<p>These songs, often auto‑composed in free style fashion, bring fans together in contagious unity.
</p>

<p>Bwede’s talents have transcended football. His face and voice are now familiar at club events, private functions, and local gatherings, where he’s frequently invited to perform. Fans don’t just cheer for his chants—they book him to bring the same joyful spirit off the terraces. His presence has become synonymous with celebration, bonding supporter culture with cultural entertainment, elevating him to a local celebrity.</p>

<p>Bwede’s commitment to Wanderers fan culture came to full recognition at the Football Association of Malawi Awards 2024. During the ceremony held in February 2025, the “Nomads” supporters—including Bwede’s leadership and creativity—were honoured as the best in the land, winning the Supporters of the Year award.
